# chromograph

## Currently contains
1. Chromgen: Binning and Gene-Activity Scoring of Cell ranger output
2. Bin analysis: TF-IDF normalization, Incremental PCA, Harmony batch correction, KNN/mKNN/RNN network, louvain clustering and tSNE/UMAP
3. Gene Activity: Aggregation, marker identification and graph skeletonization
4. Peak calling per cluster: parallelized MACS calling and HOMER annotation/motif enrichment of peaks. BigWig output for easy visualization
5. Peak Analysis: HPF factorization, KNN/mKNN/RNN network, louvain clustering and tSNE/UMAP
6. Motifs: Motif scoring based on 10X JASPAR motifs and aggregation/normalization by cluster

## To do:
* Peak / gene enrichment statistics
* Lineage inference
* Feature selection methods
* Motif enrichments
* GWAS integration
* Enhancer prediction
