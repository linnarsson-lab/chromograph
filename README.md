# chromograph

## Currently contains
1. Chromgen: Binning and Gene-Activity Scoring of Cell ranger output
2. Bin analysis: TF-IDF normalization, Incremental PCA, HPF factorization, KNN/mKNN/RNN network, louvain clustering and (art of) tSNE/UMAP
3. Peak calling per cluster: parallelized MACS calling and HOMER annotation/motif enrichment of peaks. Includes peak counting
4. Peak Analysis: HPF factorization, KNN/mKNN/RNN network, louvain clustering and (art of) tSNE/UMAP

## To do:
1. Peak calling - Downsampling for overenriched clusters
2. Peak / gene enrichment statistics
3. Lineage inference
4. Feature selection methods
5. Punchcard implementation
6. Motif enrichments
7. GWAS integration
8. Enhancer prediction
